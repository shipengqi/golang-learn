# env
```sh
usage: go env [-json] [var ...]

Env prints Go environment information.

By default env prints information as a shell script
(on Windows, a batch file). If one or more variable
names is given as arguments, env prints the value of
each named variable on its own line.

The -json flag prints the environment in JSON format
instead of as a shell script.

For more about environment variables, see 'go help environment'.
