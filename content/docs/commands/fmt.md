# fmt
```sh
usage: go fmt [-n] [-x] [packages]

Fmt runs the command 'gofmt -l -w' on the packages named
by the import paths. It prints the names of the files that are modified.

For more about gofmt, see 'go doc cmd/gofmt'.
For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.

The -n flag prints commands that would be executed.
The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.

To run gofmt with specific options, run gofmt itself.
