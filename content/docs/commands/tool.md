```sh
usage: go tool [-n] command [args...]

Tool runs the go tool command identified by the arguments.
With no arguments it prints the list of known tools.

The -n flag causes tool to print the command that would be
executed but not execute it.

For more about each tool command, see 'go doc cmd/<command>'.
